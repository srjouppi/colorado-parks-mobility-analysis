# 🌲 colorado-parks-mobility-analysis

After being given the prompt 'something I miss from home,' I decided to explore Colorado's parks. Compiling Google Search Trends, COVID-19 Mobility Data and EPA air quality reports, I told the story of how Denver residents are making use of their outdoor spaces during the pandemic.

🚙 I used Google's COVID-19 Mobility reports to compare Colorado park traffic from 2020 to 2021. 

* Python/pandas: I cleaned and formatted the dataset and ran some analysis by finding the average percent change for each week day of each season.
* ggplot/plotnine: I created exploratory visualizations to understand how park usage varied by county, day of the week and season
* Datawrapper & Illustrator: I created audience-facing visualizations to show how Denver County's park usage changed from 2020-2021 compared to the counties around it.

To get an idea for how air pollution might have affected Denver's park traffic, I used the EPA's Air Quality Index daily reports to visualize the number of days per month that were poor air quality

* Python/pandas: Cleaning and analyzing
* Datawrapper & Illustrator: Visuzalizing
